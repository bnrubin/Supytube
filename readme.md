Supytube
========

Supytube is a [Supybot](http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/) plugin that uses the YouTube API to look up information about any YouTube
links it detects in a channel.

It is tested against [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) (a supybot
fork) but might work with other forks too.
